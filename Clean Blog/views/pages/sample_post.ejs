				Teacher of Today The teacher of today is the salt of the earth. He wants
				to create a man, not just make money. He is a knowledgeable gentleman.
				He is an expert in the particular subject he teaches. Though a scholar,
				he teaches the subject in such a way that all students, brilliant or
				ordinary, can fully understand him. He doesnâ€™t advertise his knowledge.
				He cares about his students and offers assistance to them both inside
				and outside of the classroom. He attends his work regularly.
